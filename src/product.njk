                    Primary built-up members (H-Beams) are manufactured by gas cutting of HR steel plates in required sizes,
                    standards confirming to ASTM A572 Grade 345 Mpa. These plates of various sizes are welded together on one
                    side by continuous welding and on the other side by stitch welding at regular intervals to make an H-beam.
                    These are custom-built sections, so virtually any size of section can be made as per design requirement.
                    Splice plates are welded at the end of different H-beam sections. These H-beam sections are assembled
                    together by bolting the splice plates to make a complete frame assembly. The Primary members are available
                    in high-grade steel of minimum yield strength of 345 Mpa.

                    Purlins are used on the roof; girts are used on the walls, and eave struts are used at the intersection of
                    the sidewall and the roof.

                    Premier Pre-engineered Buildings offer roofing and wall cladding panels of 0.5 mm thick and 550Mpa Galvalume
                    material. Standard roof panels are made of bare Galvalume material, and wall cladding panels are of
                    color-coated Galvalume material. Panel paint film thickness is 25 microns on the exterior weather face and
                    5-7 microns of PU compatible epoxy primer on the interior face. The sheeting material is with hot dip
                    metallic coating of Galvalume 150 gm/m<sup>2</sup> total (AZ 150) as per ASTM A792 or AS 1392, and wall-coated
                    with 25 microns of regular modified polyester paint system applied on Zincalume.

                    Premier Standard Mezzanine system is a combination of profiled GI steel deck, built-up primary beams,
                    mezzanine joists, and intermediate support columns. Built-up beams span in lateral directions and mezzanine
                    joists in longitudinal directions bolted to the top flange of beams. A concrete slab is cast on the steel
                    deck as a finished surface. Shear buttons are provided on the deck panel for proper bonding of concrete with
                    the deck panel. Steel checkered plates can also be used as the top surface.

                    The use of Pre-Engineered Steel building technology in multi-storeyed construction is very popular in
                    western countries. The technological improvement in multi-storeyed construction technology and the advantage
                    of lesser time required in construction make the usage of Pre-Engineered Steel buildings increasingly
                    popular in India for multi-storeyed construction.

                <p>
                    We offer a complete solution for designing, manufacturing, and executing these steel multi-storeyed
                    buildings as per international quality standards.
