description: Our manufacturing unit is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to produce high-quality structural steel components. Premier Pre-Engineered Buildings uses HR steel plates of grade ASTM A572, known for its strength and durability. The primary members, such as H-beams, are manufactured using automated welding technology to ensure precision and consistency in quality. We follow strict quality control measures at every stage of production, ensuring that each component meets our stringent safety and performance criteria.
features:
  - Production of custom-built primary members (H-beams, columns)
  - Automated welding techniques for enhanced accuracy
  - Use of high-grade steel with a minimum yield strength of 345 MPa
  - Pre-galvanized and corrosion-resistant secondary members (purlins, girts, eave struts)
  - Flexibility to manufacture components as per unique design requirements
info: By manufacturing all critical components in-house, we maintain total control over the quality and timeline of your project.
